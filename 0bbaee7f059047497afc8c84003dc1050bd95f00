Nice!\n\nBut I don\u0027t know, whether we would really need them here, since they are used just once in this template and the template strings are readable enough without it IMHO. I think we should keep it as simple as possible for now. Since this is more a question of taste, I won\u0027t insist on that. If we go ahead with extending this chart or creating additional ones, we should maybe think about some style guidelines in general (I am missing that a lot in the official helm chart repository, which is quite messy for some charts).",
